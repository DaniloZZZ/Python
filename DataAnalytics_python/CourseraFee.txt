I'm a student at MIPT, and for me, who doesn't work yet, living only on scholarship is quite challenging. I can live for 1 - 1.5 month for the money the course costs. My family consists of my mother, two 6 and 7 y.o brothers (living in Ukraine) and me, studying abroad, here, in Moscow.

Data science is extremely popular and expanding part of computer tech nowadays. If information is the blood of humanity - data science is cardiologist.  I'me already taken 2 courses of this specialization and i enjoyed them. I'm highly interested in data analytics now. Course Certificate is valuable for me to show my competence others, to find the job i will love to work on. 

I believe that helping others is the best way to learn. So I will be glad to help anyone who needs help. Speaking about academic integrity, we have really hard tasks on Linear Algebra, Physics, Calculus here in MIPT. And after completing the tasks everyone becomes smarter. So do I. But we lack real problems of real world to solve, using the knowledge. That's what the course gives me.
